The 2019 study.
* Using the ADNi2 cohort, showed that changes in rsfMRI occurred prior to changes in MRI characteristic of the progression CN to MCI to AD.
* See the reports folder for results including journal article.
* This was a cross-sectional study.

The 2022 study. 
*Using the ADNI3 cohort.
* There were two parallel groups: a Basic and an Advanced.  The Basic and Advanced refer to aspects of the imaging protocol.
* In this study we looked at the progression from CN to SMC to EMCI to LMCI.  These were cross-sectional studies.
* See the reports folder for results including AAIC abstracts and posters. This folder also contains RMarkdown reports for individual analysis.
* See the src folder for sample R Code and shell scripts needed to execute the complex workflow.  The workflow involved FreeSurfer, AFNI, and home-grown ANOVA code.
